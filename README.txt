# Kickstarting with Excel

## Project Overview
	
	## This is a project to determine the feasibility of using crowdsourcing to fund a play named Fever. 

	## Our client, Louise, came close to her goal based on our analysis. The following analysis to determine
	how successful other crowdsourced campaigns have been, in relation to their launch dates and their initial
	funding goal. 

#Analysis and Challenges
	
	#Challenges
		The most challenging part of this project was utilyzing previously unused functions. I chose to figure out 
		the functions on my own rather than clicking the hints in the module. This helped me to really figure it out 
		on my own and hopefully ingrain that knowledge. This was a relatively linear data set, and we didn't have to 
		dig too deep to find some patterns.

	#Analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date
		The overwhelming majority of successful campaigns begin in the period between the start of Spring and the 
		end of Summer, with the peak being reached during the month of May. As the weather gets cooler, there seeems
		to be less interest in crowdfunding for the Theatre. 

	#Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals
		The vast majority of successful total projects have a goal of less than 10000 dollars. The percentage, 89.7%,
		makes it obvious that having a reasonable amount for your goal is the biggest factor in determining success. It
		should also be noted that there were zero cancelations in the plays subcategory.

	#Broad Analysis / Results
		I think that the unique nature of this data doesn't allow it to interpreted easily by black and white categories 
		such as successful and failed. The client is looking for a measure of success, and a project not reaching the full
		100% funding goal, isn't necessarily a project that fails. There are alot of grey areas in this data, and obviously
		a more in depth analysis would point this out. I think we could add additional tables including data from the other 
		subsets of the Theater category. 

		The general sense from this data, looking only from a Theatre perspective, is that most projects (66.5%) are successful 
		in reaching their fundraising goal. To improve these chances, it is best to begin a campaign in the Spring, ensuring that
		the amount requested is reasonable.
